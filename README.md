# FoodHub

A [SnappFood](https://snappfood.ir/about) (or [UberEats](https://about.ubereats.com/)) clone in JavaFX.

This application was my final's project for the **advanced programming** university course, originally made in **2019**.

## Simple build & run

Make sure you have **Oracle JDK 10** installed and configured; then issue the following command:

```shell
# On a Linux OS
./gradlew run
```

```powershell
# Or if you are on Windows:
./gradlew.bat run
```

> It might be tricky getting it working, as it is now considered a legacy software.

The example databases' data and the images are not mine; I found them on the Internet using Google search engine.
