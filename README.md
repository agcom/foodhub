# FoodHub

A [SnappFood](https://snappfood.ir/about) (or [UberEats](https://about.ubereats.com/)) clone in JavaFX.

This application was my final's project for the **advanced programming** university course, originally made in **2019**.

## Simple build & run

```shell
# On a Linux OS
./gradlew run
```

```powershell
# Or if you are on Windows:
./gradlew.bat run
```
